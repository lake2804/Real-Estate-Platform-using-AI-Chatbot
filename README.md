# Real-Estate-Platform-using-AI-Chatbot

## üè° Project Overview

This project demonstrates a **Real Estate Platform** integrated with an **AI Chatbot**, designed to help users easily search for properties, get answers to their questions, and facilitate interactions between buyers and sellers. The AI chatbot enhances user experience by offering automated support in finding relevant listings and answering property-related inquiries.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **HTML**: For structuring the content and layout of the platform.
- **CSS**: For styling the user interface and enhancing the visual appeal.
- **JavaScript**: To handle user interactions and dynamic elements on the platform.

### Backend
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment for building the backend server.
- **Express**: A web framework for Node.js, used to set up server-side routes and APIs.
- **MongoDB/MySQL**: Potential databases for storing property listings, user information, and transaction data.

### AI Chatbot
- The AI Chatbot is integrated into the platform to provide the following functionalities:
  - **Property Search Assistance**: Helps users find properties based on their preferences.
  - **Query Resolution**: Answers common questions related to listings, pricing, and availability.
  - **Lead Qualification**: Connects users with suitable listings or agents based on their inputs.

## üß± Project Structure

The project is divided into two main sections:

- **`backend/`**: Contains the backend code that handles the server logic, API endpoints, and database connections.
- **`frontend/`**: Contains the client-side code that interacts with the user, displays property listings, and communicates with the backend.
