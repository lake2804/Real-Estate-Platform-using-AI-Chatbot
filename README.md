# Real-Estate-Platform-using-AI-Chatbot

## üè° Project Overview

This project demonstrates a **Real Estate Platform** integrated with an **AI Chatbot**, designed to help users easily search for properties, get answers to their questions, and facilitate interactions between buyers and sellers. The AI chatbot enhances user experience by offering automated support in finding relevant listings and answering property-related inquiries.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **HTML**: For structuring the content and layout of the platform.
- **CSS**: For styling the user interface and enhancing the visual appeal.
- **JavaScript**: To handle user interactions and dynamic elements on the platform.

### Backend
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment for building the backend server.
- **Express**: A web framework for Node.js, used to set up server-side routes and APIs.
- **MongoDB/MySQL**: Potential databases for storing property listings, user information, and transaction data.

### AI Chatbot
- The AI Chatbot is integrated into the platform to provide the following functionalities:
  - **Property Search Assistance**: Helps users find properties based on their preferences.
  - **Query Resolution**: Answers common questions related to listings, pricing, and availability.
  - **Lead Qualification**: Connects users with suitable listings or agents based on their inputs.

## üß± Project Structure

The project is divided into two main sections:

- **`backend/`**: Contains the backend code that handles the server logic, API endpoints, and database connections.
- **`frontend/`**: Contains the client-side code that interacts with the user, displays property listings, and communicates with the backend.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lake2804/Real-Estate-Platform-using-AI-Chatbot.git
cd Real-Estate-Platform-using-AI-Chatbot
````

### 2. Frontend Setup

Navigate to the `frontend/` directory and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

Start the frontend server:

```bash
npm start
```

### 3. Backend Setup

Navigate to the `backend/` directory and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Start the backend server:

```bash
npm start
```

Make sure the backend server is running before you start the frontend to ensure proper communication between the two.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Variables

The backend server requires certain environment variables to be configured for proper operation. It's recommended to use a `.env` file in the `backend` directory for local development.

Create a file named `.env` in the `backend/` directory with the following content:

```env
# MongoDB Connection String
DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/real_estate_db

# JWT Secret Key for token signing (important: use a strong, unique secret)
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secure_jwt_secret_key_please_change_me

# Port for the backend server
PORT=4000

# Base URL for the frontend to make API calls (if configured this way)
# Typically, the frontend (Nuxt) might have its own proxy or runtime config for this.
# This is an example if the backend needs to know its own public URL or for frontend .env
# API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000/api
```

**Note:** For a production environment, ensure these variables are set securely (e.g., through your hosting provider's interface). In a team project, it's good practice to have a `.env.example` file committed to the repository, but for this task, this documentation suffices.

### üß™ Running Tests

The backend includes a suite of unit and integration tests developed using Jest. To run these tests:

1.  Navigate to the backend directory:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
2.  Execute the test script:
    ```bash
    npm test
    ```

This will run all tests located in the `backend/__tests__` directory. The tests cover various aspects of the application, including controller logic (unit tests) and API endpoint functionality (integration tests).

**Note on Test Execution:**
Currently, there might be limitations in some sandboxed environments affecting `npm install` for test dependencies (like Jest and Supertest) and subsequently `npm test` execution. The test scripts and necessary configuration files have been set up, and tests should run correctly in a local development environment where Node.js package installation is working as expected.

## üß™ Development and Contribution

We welcome contributions to this project! If you want to contribute, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
3. Make your changes.
4. Commit your changes and push your branch.
5. Create a pull request from your branch to the main repository.

## üìå Notes

* This repository does not yet contain detailed documentation. It would be great to add further documentation on the setup process, features, and usage instructions.
* You may want to consider adding a **LICENSE** file to specify the licensing terms.
* For better user experience, including sample data or a live demo link would be beneficial for showcasing the platform‚Äôs functionality.
